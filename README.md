# Sign-Flex-app
senior design app

Designing the SignFlex mobile application involves more than just a fancy UI—it’s about real-time responsiveness, reliable connectivity, and a user-friendly interface that makes ASL translation intuitive. By focusing on key components—Bluetooth/Wi-Fi communication, TTS, gesture visualizations, calibrations—and ensuring robust error handling, the app will serve as the final link that translates sensor/ML outputs into meaningful, user-facing feedback.
